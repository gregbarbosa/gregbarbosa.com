An incredibly good read on how to use survey/quiz marketing funnels to understand what customers want, and then deliver it to them through the best messaging possible. The only negative feedback I can think of is that the book could have been nearly 70 pages shorter. There's a lot of context given that doesn't seem to pan out in the long story, in the grand scheme of things. On top of that, lots of chapters seemed a little bit out of order. For example, I would've preferred to understand or read case studies, before jumping into the actual methodology. It would've validated my drive to understand the benefits of this survey funnel system. On top of that I think the knowledge mints also should've been at the beginning of the book. The background story and context on one on why Ryan did what he did, it's a good story, but feels disconnected and disjointed from the methodology section. It's primed and set up in such a way that you think it's going to tell this long story and build up to this grand showcase of an answer, but it never actually does. Overall very happy to have read this, and very happy to be able to see the connections that these types of systems have been published out in the real world. I already have ideas on how I can apply this into my own businesses, and I'm ready to dive in.
