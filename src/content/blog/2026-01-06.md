## Hypothesis

Blogging should be as easy as sending an email. Every platform or tech stack made it cumbersome requiring logins, special editors, or custom apps. Nothing was as easy as writing a note and sending it out.

## Core Stack

- Astro website
- Obsidian + Obsidian Git installed
  - Configure Obsidian Git to use your entire repo as the vault
  - Add .obsidian to your .gitignore
  - Use File Explorer++ to hide all folders except for the `src/` folder

## Tips

- Daily Note
  - Set a hotkey
  - Make it use your Blog Post template
  - Hit the hotkey and get right into writing
