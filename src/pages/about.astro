					Started Freelancing in 2010, Remote since 2016, full-time since 2018.
				</h2>
				<p>
					I'm Greg Barbosa. By day, I'm a Director of Innovation and Systems at
					Avulux. The rest of the time, I'm usually building
					something—open-source tools, side projects, whatever's stuck in my
					head. I also shoot photos when I remember to leave the house.
				</p>

				<p>
					I like figuring things out and writing about what I learn. This site
					is where I put the technical stuff, creative projects, and the
					occasional thing that doesn't fit anywhere else.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you want to collaborate, have me speak at something, or just say
					hi—<a href="/contact">reach out</a>.
				</p>

				Hi, I'm Greg.
